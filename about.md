I set up this site to do basic page view counting using [the free hosting tier](https://umami.is/pricing) of [umami](https://umami.is/), which is free and open source software.

You can easily opt out using do-not-track in your browser settings. You might have done this already, by default, depending on which browser you use. For example, in Firefox: <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature>

My website will fully respect your do-not-track setting, and if you want to be completely sure, you can always use a VPN or whatever.

This doesn't collect much data at all, just what language your browser is set to, and an anonymous total of how many times each page has been visited. The full details are here (under the Pageviews subheading): <https://umami.is/docs/tracker-functions>

Furthermore you can view all the data publicly here: <https://analytics.umami.is/share/Cs0XCZj1hvgxB5R4/joels.me>
